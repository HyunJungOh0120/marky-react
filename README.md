## üõ† Process - Trials

#### 1. Selenium - AWS3

<img src = "./public/img/trial1.png" width='600'/>

- First, I had a plan to add highlighting feature as well as memo on article detail page. Tried selenium with chrome extension (PageToPdf) and uploaded to aws3 using django-storages & boto3. However on Client side, pdf flie got 'access denied' . Selenium took too long time

<br/>
<br/>

#### 2. Playwright - Cloudinary

<img src = "./public/img/trial2.png" width='600'/>

- Rather than selenium which needs chrome driver to be installed locally, Playwright also uses chrominium but it's much faster and light so I proceeded till the end of project. However, on Heroku and Google cloud, I got an error with 'ModuleNotFoundError: playwright' and couldn't deploy properly.
  Tried with heroku buildpack for playwright but it caused RunTimeError.

- Also tried pdfkit (python library) to create pdf, however this also needs local program 'wkhtmltopdf'

- On production: deployment, the feature to show pdf/screenshot of specific url address is removed. However, still leaving memo, sorting articles by creating categories are available.
